# PetPal — Microcopy Inventory

> **Status: inventory only.** This is a complete pass over every product-facing string in [`wireframes/*.html`](../wireframes/) (123 files, 622 unique strings). **Nothing here is rewritten** — this document only *records* and *flags*. By end of lesson it becomes the single source of truth that the rewrites are made against.

**Scope.** Extracted from the on-device content (mobile view; desktop is an identical copy). **Excluded as prototype chrome, not product text:** the left sidebar catalog, the Success/Empty/Loading/Error state-bar, the flow-step breadcrumb, and the persona-flow tooltips. **Method:** [`scratchpad/extract_copy.py`](../../..) — regex over each screen's content region, deduplicated to one row per unique string with a "seen on" count.

Because a handful of strings (e.g. `← Dossier` ×46) repeat across dozens of screens, the inventory lists **one row per unique string** with the screens it appears on — rather than repeating identical rows 40+ times. The requested columns (screen · area · row · type) are all present; area/type also drive the section grouping.

| Set-up-a-pet | Pet name * · Species * · Breed · Sex · Microchip · Photo | field label | |
| Owner (Me) | Full name · Email · Phone · Language | field label | |

### Placeholders

| Screen(s) | Text | Type | Flag |
|---|---|---|---|

| Set-up-a-pet | **e.g. Miso, Miso, Buddy** | placeholder | 🟣 **BUG — "Miso" listed twice** |
| Add-record | e.g. Rabies, DHPP, Leptospirosis | placeholder | ✅ |
| various | e.g. Dr. Müller, Tierklinik am Stadtpark · e.g. Border Terrier, Tabby stray · e.g. Lassie, Petplan, Agila | placeholder | ✅ good `e.g.` pattern |
| Add-record | Context-aware form — fields adapt to record type. Shown: vaccination. | body | 🟣 **dev/meta note leaked into UI** |
| Login | you@example.com · •••••••• · 8+ characters | placeholder | |

### Dropdown options (all controlled — listed for the source of truth)

## 8 · Confirmations & destructive actions

| Screen(s) | Text | Type | Flag |
|---|---|---|---|
| Reminder-done | Nice — marked done | heading | 🟡 "Nice —" (see §11-C) |
| home-new done modal | Nice — Miso's dossier is ready! | heading | 🟡 `!` |
| home-progress-6 modal | **Awesome — all set up! 🎉** | heading | 🟡 emoji + `!` + "Awesome" |
| Share-success | Miso's share link is ready | heading | |
| Share-sent | **Your pet's info was shared! 🎉** | heading | 🟡 emoji + `!` |

| Log-out modal | Log out? | heading | |

---

## 9 · Consistency of the back-button pattern

Header back-buttons mostly follow **`← [destination]`**: `← Dossier`, `← My Pets`, `← Share`, `← Who has access`, `← What's due`, `← Documents`, `← Emergency info`, `← Miso's profile`. **Exception:** `← Cancel` (add/edit forms) uses an *action* word in the destination slot. 🟠

`section` / `block`: **checked — consistent.** Product copy only ever says "section" (`View in section`, `Search sections`, `k of 6 sections filled`). "block" appears **only** inside user-authored walking-routine sample text ("around the block"), never as UI. ✅

---

## 10 · Sample / user-authored content — 📝 **we do not control or rewrite this**

These are demo values standing in for what a real owner would type. They must **not** be treated as product copy; when real content design starts, they stay as illustrative examples only.

| Kind | Sample values in the prototype |
|---|---|
| Pet identity | Miso (Dog · Border Terrier · Female · DOB 2022-03-15 · Microchip 276 098 106 412 345); Cheetah (Cat · Tabby stray · Female) |
| Owner identity | Eva Schmidt · eva.schmidt@example.com · +49 171 9876543 · Berlin |
| Vaccine / record names | Rabies · DHPP · Leptospirosis · Dental cleaning · Annual checkup · General check-up · Vaccination (Rabies + DHPP) · Dermatitis follow-up |
| Care-note bodies | "Royal Canin Maxi Adult, 350 g twice daily…", "Calm and affectionate. Loves belly rubs…", "Small rodents (strong prey drive)…", "Morning walk 30 min (around the block)…", etc. |
| Vet / clinic | Tierklinik am Stadtpark · Dr. Müller · Parkstraße 12, 10115 Berlin · +49 30 1234567 |
| Insurance | Lassie Haustierversicherung · OP-Schutz Plus · LSS-2024-0847291 · €29.90/month |
| Documents | EU Pet Passport DE-0812345 · Microchip registration · Rabies certificate · Pedigree papers |
| Emergency | Carer authorization up to €500 · allowed meds notes |
| Dates / numbers | 15 Mar 2027, 1 Oct 2026, 12 Nov 2026, etc. |

*(The `e.g. …` placeholders in §7 are product copy — they're the app suggesting what to type — even though they contain sample-flavoured words. Only actual field **values** and body content above are user territory.)*

## 11 · Consistency findings (the flag summary)

### A. 🔴 Same thing, different names — **decide one term each**

| Concept | Terms found in the wild | Where |
|---|---|---|
| The owner's whole pet record | **dossier** ("Pet dossier", "← Dossier", "Miso's dossier") **vs** **profile** ("Miso's profile", "care profile", "Loading Miso's shared profile") **vs** title **"My pet"** vs pet name as title ("Miso") | dossier, all `-loading`/`-error`, Shared-pet-view |
| The Personality & care section | called a **section** in the dossier, but its status reads **"Profile filled"** and its copy says the note "will appear in **the profile**" | dossier card, Personality, Add-care-note |
| The sitter's read-only view | **"Shared pet view"** (name) vs **"Miso's profile"** (back link) vs **"shared profile"** (loading) vs **"shared view"** (body) vs the mockup's **"Shared card"** | Shared-pet-view + states |
| A shot | **jab** ("Health & jabs") vs **vaccine** ("+ Add vaccine") vs **vaccination** ("Add vaccination", "Vaccinations", option "Vaccination") | Health-and-jabs, Add-record |
| Emergency permissions | **authorisation** ("Emergency info & authorisation") vs **authorization** ("Save authorization", "authorization settings", "Emergency authorization setup") | Emergency screens — also a **British/American spelling** split (favourite/behaviour are British → pick `-isation`) |
| Creating an account | screen/nav **"Sign up"** vs button **"Create account"** | Sign-up |
| Contacting a person | **Call** ("Call vet", "Call Eva") vs **Contact** ("Contact Eva", "Contact owner") | Emergency, Shared-pet-view |

### B. 🟠 Same action, different button labels — **pick one pattern**

- **Add:** `Add` / `+ Add` / `Add a pet` / `Add your first pet` / `+ Add your first pet` / `+ Add info` / `Upload` — the **`+` prefix is applied inconsistently**, and "Upload" competes with "Add" for documents.
- **Save:** `Save` / `Save record` / `Save note` / `Save pet` / `Save authorization` / `Save settings` / `Save changes` — bare "Save" vs "Save [noun]" vs "Save changes".
- **Retry:** `Try again` (×17) / `Retry` / `Retry save`.
- **Delete:** `Delete` / `Delete this note` / `Delete this record` / `Delete profile` / `Permanently delete Miso`.
- **Preview sharing:** `Preview as sitter` vs `See what your sitter sees`.
- **Share again:** `Share with someone new` vs `Share with a pet sitter` vs `Re-share`.
- **Back:** `← [destination]` everywhere **except** `← Cancel`.
- **Edit:** `Edit` vs `Edit →` vs `Edit pet details`.

### C. 🟡 AI clichés & over-cheerful tone

- **"Something went wrong"** — the classic filler, used as the **heading on 10 error screens**. (The *bodies* underneath are specific and good — the generic heading is the weak link.)
- **Emojis in headings:** `Awesome — all set up! 🎉`, `Your pet's info was shared! 🎉`.
- **Exclusive exclamation cluster:** `Shared!`, `Done! This is what your sitter sees`, `Nice — Miso's dossier is ready!`, `Nice — marked done`, `Awesome — all set up!` — repeated "Nice —" / "Awesome" openers.
- **Overwrought for context:** the saving spinner's "Let us save your updated info so we can store it and keep it accessible for you at any moment."

### D. 🟣 Stray / placeholder / meta text still in the UI

- **`e.g. Miso, Miso, Buddy`** — pet-name placeholder lists "Miso" twice (bug).
- **`Context-aware form — fields adapt to record type. Shown: vaccination.`** — a developer/meta note showing in the Add-record form.
- **`Action`** — the primary button on the Reminder-detail screen is literally labelled "Action" (placeholder that shipped).

### E. ⚪ Prototype annotations (not product copy — strip before shipping)

Wireframe **zone-labels** are visible on screen but are scaffolding, not UI text: `Pet identity`, `Counter`, `Search & filter`, `Card entry point → …`, `Main job · step n of 4`, `R1, R3`, etc. Listed here only so they aren't mistaken for microcopy to rewrite — they should be **removed** in the visual-design build.

---

*Next step (not this pass): turn §11 into decisions — one canonical term per concept, one label per action, an error/empty/success voice spec — and apply them back across the 123 screens.*
